# Expense-Tracker-
This is my first project built with Python and SQLite.

It's a command-line based expense tracker that allows you to:
💸 Add expenses
📋 View all expenses
❌ Delete expenses
🗓️ View daily summaries
📂 Filter by category

I'm learning step-by-step and building this with pure Python.The goal is to understand the core first.

Features
Stores data in a local SQLite database
Clean menu interface
Simple data formatting for easy reading
Handles categories and custom dates
Designed to be extended into a web app next

What’s Next
I plan to:
Build a web version using HTML + Flask
Add export-to-CSV functionality

Improve input validation and error handling
